# 2021 SoDA Bootcamp: Final Code

This is the code for the portfolio site created live during [SoDA's 2021 Bootcamp](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVyxYedAxbK/). It uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The
bootcamp was split into three sections based on coding language. You can view the checkpoints for each section here:

* [HTML](https://github.com/asusoda/SoDA-Bootcamp/tree/html-checkpoint)
* [CSS](https://github.com/asusoda/SoDA-Bootcamp/tree/css-checkpoint)
* [JavaScript](https://github.com/asusoda/SoDA-Bootcamp/tree/javascript-checkpoint)

## Running

There is a live version of the site at https://thesoda.io/SoDA-Bootcamp/. To run it locally, you can run a server in the project directory. We suggest using the
[`live-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) npm package for this, so that the website reloads automatically whenever you change it. You can also open `index.html`
in your browser without using a server.
